  "story": {
    "origin": "SecureDrop started as an idea to solve the growing issue of package theft and delivery fraud. I wanted to design a system that could give customers more control over their deliveries.",
    "journey": "The project began with high-level diagrams and workflows, evolving into a Proof-of-Concept with QR and OTP-based authorization. I built it as a multi-component system with a landing page, a B2C app, a B2B SDK, and optional admin tools.",
    "growth": "With each iteration, I explored how brands could seamlessly integrate SecureDrop into their backends, while customers could enjoy peace of mind knowing deliveries required explicit authorization.",
    "current": "SecureDrop is currently an ongoing PoC, with planned expansions into NFC-based verification, AI anomaly detection, and blockchain-backed audit logs."
